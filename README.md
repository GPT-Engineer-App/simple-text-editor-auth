# simple-text-editor-auth

make a super simple text editor. 

Add a login flow that forces users to autenticate before seeing the home page.  Use the  Supabase REST API and assume I have a server with following properties: 
- Project URL: https://mnwefvnykbgyhbdzpleh.supabase.co
-ANON KEY: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1ud2Vmdm55a2JneWhiZHpwbGVoIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MTMyNzQ3MzQsImV4cCI6MjAyODg1MDczNH0.tnHysd1LqayzpQ1L-PImcvlkUmkNvocpMS7tS-hYZNg

Make sure you handle redirects and also give the user an option to logout once logged in.
